We adopt a meta-model in which possibly mobile, interconnected and communicating agents work according to a set of chemical-like laws. According to this view, substantiated by recent research on pervasive computing systems, we present the Alchemist simulation framework, which retains the performance of known Stochastic Simulation Algorithms for (bio)chemistry, though it is tailored to the specific features of complex and situated computational systems.",

L'interfaccia grafica permette la configurazione completa di una simulazione ed il suo avvio in modalit{\`a} normale o batch. Per il suo sviluppo, {\`e} stata utilizzata la libreria JavaFX, che ha permesso di separare l'aspetto del programma dalla specifica comportamentale, e supporta l'Hi-DPI, che consente al simulatore di essere scalabile anche su schermi ad alta risoluzione. L'ambiente ottenuto {\`e} intuitivo, perch{\'e} offre un'esperienza d'uso simile ad un IDE di sviluppo; ed {\`e} anche consistente rispetto allo stato del file system. Nel testo sono illustrati tutti i requisiti che il progetto deve soddisfare e, inoltre, sono descritte, in modo approfondito, la progettazione e l'implementazione dell'interfaccia realizzata. Il risultato ottenuto {\`e} un ambiente funzionante, che soddisfa buona parte delle specifiche richieste e che potr{\`a} essere ampliato in futuro con nuove funzionalit{\`a}.},

    abstract    = {Abstract An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called “the reaction probability density function.” The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.}

    abstract    = {We present randomized algorithms to solve the following string-matching problem and some of its generalizations: Given a string X of length n (the pattern) and a string Y (the text), find the first occurrence of X as a consecutive block within Y. The algorithms represent strings of length n by much shorter strings called fingerprints, and achieve their efficiency by manipulating fingerprints instead of longer strings. The algorithms require a constant number of storage locations, and essentially run in real time. They are conceptually simple and easy to implement. The method readily generalizes to higher-dimensional pattern-matching problems.},
